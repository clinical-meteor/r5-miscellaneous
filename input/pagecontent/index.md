# R5 Patient Introduction

Welcome to the Patient Introduction to Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).  If you've recently been told about something called 'fire' related to your Personal Health Records, you're in the right place.  The following document will give a brief overview of how you as a patient can access your own personal health records under various government laws.  

### What is the benefit of the record to the patient?  
Taking ownership of one's healthrecords can be a lifechanging and empowering decision.  Rather than guessing about your health, one can participate in the process of measuring and understanding your health.  

### How does FHIR help me as a patient?
- Aggregate your health records from your health clinics to -  - Better understand your health
- Make sure your data is correct
- Share your records
- Download your billing records from your payors
- Surgical or procedure planning
- Maintain compliance to a careplan or treatment plan.


#### What is FHIR?  
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a data specification for sharing healthcare data.  Unlike prior standards, FHIR is based on web standards.  Fundamentally, its "healthcare + internet".  

#### Where can I get them?  
Many participating healthcare systems and technology vendors are already supporting FHIR records, including the electronic medical record systems of the largest hospitals in the US, as well as major tech vendors such as Apple.  


#### How do I use it?  How do I access my FHIR records?   
To access your records requires having a personal health record (PHR) running on your mobile device or desktop computer.  

- A FHIR application (either an app on a phone or online)
- Portal credentials for your healthcare organizations
 
### Where can I find FHIR applications?
Some health organizations have lists of FHIR applications on their website.

#### Why do I need copies of my Health Records?  

Patient surveys show that a major reason patients tend to be interested in having copies of their own healthrecords is to check for accuracy and errors.  When a medical record has an error, it can result in safety issues with dire consequences.  Amongst the most common errors are left/right errors and having contents in the record from another patient.  Getting copies of your records can help assure that your records are accurate.

Patients often request copies of their own records when they want to take a more active ownership of their own health.  This often happens after a health incident where a person re-evaluates their habits and seek to implement new careplans and new routines. And can be as simple as tracking personal fitness goals or as complex as doing a complete quantified self workup and measure metabolic biomarkers on a monthly or quarterly basis.  

#### Getting a copy of your records  
Health records are available from many organizations, although they all tend to be password and account protected according to various privacy laws.  Which is precisely why they tend to be restricted and patient access is even an issue of concern.  

Typically, one will first want to check with one's local hospital or clinic or laboratory, to see if they have a patient portal.  If so, sign up and look there for downloadable data.  Typically, these documents will be provided in PDF format.  

Second, consumer Health Information Exchanges such as provide users with browsable directories of participating providers they can download their data from.

### What Data is Included?



##### Argonaut
Besides being a bad pun on JSON and the Argonauts, the Argonaut project is one of the oldest FHIR projects, and comprises a set of core data resources that EHR vendors have agreed to use to communicate clinical findings.  Argonaut resources include things like Allergy Intolerance, Condition, Immunization, Patient, Observation, and Procedure.  

##### International Patient Summary  
International Patient Summary is an European Union led project, focusing on patient summaries as they are exchanged between different countries in the EU.  Particular attention is given to different languages and terminologies, and necessary documentation for crossing borders (such as vaccines).

##### Vaccine Card InImplementationGuide-WaterClosetGuide.jsonitiative ??

##### US Common Data for Interoperability (USCDI)  
USCDI is a set of basic data that the US Government expects applications and technology vendors to support in order to obtain certification as an interoperability compliant product or service.  



#### Implementator Section  
Patients that wish to build tools and utilities using their own health records will have additional interests and needs.
